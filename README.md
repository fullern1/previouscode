# previouscode
Homework assignments and projects from previous CMSC courses.

Organized by language with descriptions and files provided by professors if available.

I do not have all the records and starting files for all my previous work, I will do my best to describe which portions of code I worked on if needed.

All files included are what were present in the directory when I copied them at the end of the project/semester.

Some files (primes.h especially) skew the percent display of languages.
